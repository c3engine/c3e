## Session 15 — 2026-07 (Phase 13.6 Continuation History)

**Built:**
- Phase 13.6 complete across 3 files:
  - `src/search/mod.rs` — Added `cont_hist: Box<[[[i32; 64]; 12]; 64]>` to `SearchInfo`.
    Indexed as `cont_hist[prev_to][piece_idx][curr_to]` where `piece_idx = kind*2 + color`.
    Methods: `get_cont_hist()`, `update_cont_hist()` (same gravity formula as history).
    Zeroed in `reset_for_search()`; not preserved across moves (position-dependent).
    2 new tests: `test_cont_hist_update_get`, `test_cont_hist_reset_on_search`.
  - `src/search/ordering.rs` — `score_move()` gains `prev_move: Move` parameter;
    cont_hist score added to quiet-move history when `prev_move != NULL`.
    `update_ordering_on_cutoff()` gains `pos: &Position` parameter; updates cont_hist
    for the cutoff move (bonus) and all quiets tried before it (penalty).
    Updated existing test; added `test_cont_hist_boosts_quiet_score`.
  - `src/search/alpha_beta.rs` — One-line delta: pass `pos` to `update_ordering_on_cutoff()`.

**Architecture decisions:**
- None new — cont_hist follows same gravity formula as D5/history convention.

**Next session start point:**
Phase 13.7 — Node count benchmarking vs known engines.
- Implement a `perft_bench` or fixed-depth node count test comparing Pet Dragon vs
  reference (Ethereal/Stockfish) at depth 8–10 from standard start.
- Add to `tests/` or as a binary benchmark in `benches/` (Criterion).
- Baseline: record nodes searched at depth 10, note NPS.
- Then Phase 14 (Texel tuning) vs going straight to Phase 16 (NNUE) — decision point.

---

## Session 14 — 2026-07 (Phase 13.5 Quiescence Improvements)

**Built:**
- Phase 13.5 complete across 2 files:
  - `src/search/alpha_beta.rs` — `quiescence()` rewritten with 4 improvements:
    1. Added `qs_depth: i32` parameter (0 = allow quiet checks; <0 = captures only)
    2. In-check path: `generate_moves()` for all evasions, no stand-pat allowed,
       empty move list → `-(MATE_SCORE - ply)` checkmate score
    3. Per-capture delta pruning: `stand_pat + captured_val + 200 < alpha → skip`
       (more precise than global delta; uses `QS_CAPTURE_VALUES[6]` constant)
    4. Quiet checks at qs_depth ≥ 0: quiet moves with positive SEE that give check
       searched after captures, recurse with qs_depth = -1 (1 level deep only)
    - Both call sites updated (leaf node, razoring) → pass `qs_depth = 0`
    - 3 new tests: `test_qsearch_in_check_generates_evasions`,
      `test_qsearch_checkmate_detection`, `test_qsearch_qs_depth_parameter_no_panic`
  - `src/search/pruning.rs` — `try_probcut`: quiescence called with `qs_depth = -1`
    (captures only; avoids quiet-check overhead in probcut verification)

**Architecture decisions:**
- qs_depth = 0 at all main-search → qsearch entries (leaf node + razoring)
- qs_depth = -1 for probcut and all recursive qsearch calls
- In-check evasions use `score_moves()` (killers + history) for ordering quality
- Quiet check recursion is capped at 1 level (passes -1) to prevent tree explosion
- History gravity already present in `update_history()` — no new code needed for that half of 13.6

**Next session start point:**
Phase 13.6 — Continuation history (history gravity already implemented).
- Add `cont_hist: Box<[[[i32; 64]; 12]; 64]>` to `SearchInfo` in `src/search/mod.rs`
  (64 prev_to squares × 12 piece-color types × 64 curr_to squares = 192KB, needs Box)
- Initialize in `SearchInfo::new()` and `new_with_stop()`
- Clear in `reset_for_search()`
- In `src/search/ordering.rs` `score_move()`: add cont_hist lookup for quiet moves
  `score += info.cont_hist[prev_to][piece_idx][to]` (needs prev_move propagated)
- In `src/search/ordering.rs` `update_ordering_on_cutoff()`: update cont_hist on beta cutoff
- Then 13.7: node count benchmarking vs Ethereal at fixed depth

---

## Session 13 — 2026-07 (Phase 13.4 Lazy SMP)

**Built:**
- Phase 13.4 Lazy SMP complete across 6 files:
  - `src/tt/mod.rs` — `store()` changed to `&self`, `unsafe impl Send/Sync` added
  - `src/search/mod.rs` — `Arc<AtomicBool> stop_flag` in SearchInfo, `new_with_stop()` constructor, `is_time_up()` checks shared flag
  - `src/search/alpha_beta.rs` — all `tt: &mut TranspositionTable` → `tt: &TranspositionTable`
  - `src/search/iterative.rs` — same signature change + test call sites updated
  - `src/search/pruning.rs` — `try_probcut` signature updated
  - `src/main.rs` — full rewrite: `go` non-blocking, `stop` works, N-1 helper threads, history preserved across moves

**Architecture decisions:**
- TT shared via Arc, lock-free writes per D4 (benign races, key verification in probe)
- Each thread has own SearchInfo (no killer/history sharing — simpler, avoids data races)
- Main thread returns SearchInfo on join; history/countermoves/correction_history merged back
- Helper threads use infinite TC; killed by shared stop_flag when main finishes
- bestmove printed inside spawned thread (not main loop) — correct UCI semantics

**Next session start point:**
Phase 14.1 — Evaluation improvements: PST (piece-square tables) from Ethereal. Read `src/eval/tables.rs` first (may not exist yet). Then implement material.rs integration with full HCE.

---

## Session 12 — Phase 13.1–13.3: Probcut, CorrectionHistory, Singular Extensions

**Date**: 2026-06-30
**Build entering session**: #129 green (Phase 12 complete, Phase 13 untouched)
**Build leaving session**: #136 green

### What Was Done
- 13.1 — Wired Probcut (`pruning::try_probcut`/`should_try_probcut`) into
  `alpha_beta.rs`, called after IIR and before move generation.
- 13.2 — Wired CorrectionHistory into `alpha_beta.rs`: raw static eval is
  corrected via `info.correction_history.apply()` before all pruning
  decisions (razoring, null move, futility); the raw (uncorrected) eval and
  final `best_score` feed `correction_history.update()` at node exit
  (skipped when in check, search aborted, or result is a mate score).
  Added `correction_history: CorrectionHistory` field to `SearchInfo`
  (`src/search/mod.rs`), persisted across searches like history/countermoves.
- 13.3 — Singular extensions: TT move gets a verification search (reduced
  depth, excluded from the normal move loop) at `depth >= MIN_DEPTH_SINGULAR
  (6)`. If every alternative fails to reach `tt_score - 2*depth`, the TT
  move is "singular" and gets +1 ply when actually searched.

### Decisions Made
- **D16** (new — see DECISIONS.md): introduced `alpha_beta_with_excluded()`
  as the real search body; public `alpha_beta()` is now a thin wrapper
  passing `excluded = Move::NULL`. Keeps the public signature — and every
  existing call site in `iterative.rs` and all test modules — untouched.

### Bugs Fixed
- **Build #129→#136**: `MIN_DEPTH_SINGULAR` constant was added to
  `search/mod.rs` but never added to the `use crate::search::{...}` import
  list in `alpha_beta.rs` — bare reference failed to resolve (E0425).
  Fixed by adding it to the existing import block. One-line delta, confirmed
  green at #136.

### Next Session Start Point
1. Confirm #136 test count (should still be 296+ tests, none removed) —
   spot check `test_iterative_deepening_depth_increases` (depth 8, fixed)
   and `test_aspiration_window_handles_score_drop` (depth 6) since these are
   the two existing tests most likely to exercise the new singular-extension
   path (flagged as a risk last session, came back green so no action needed).
2. Start **13.4 — Lazy SMP** (multi-threaded parallel search). This is the
   biggest Phase 13 item — needs `Arc<AtomicBool>` stop flag shared across
   threads, a way to share/synchronize the TT (already lock-free per D4, so
   no change needed there), and per-thread `SearchInfo` (history/killers
   not safely shareable — each thread needs its own, root move merged at
   the end). Read `src/search/mod.rs` and `src/main.rs` fresh before
   starting since main.rs owns the single `EngineState` that Lazy SMP will
   need to fan out from.
3. Alternative if 13.4 feels too large for one session: do 13.5
   (quiescence improvements) or 13.6 (history gravity/continuation history)
   first — both are smaller, contained to existing single-threaded files.

## Session 11 — Phases 10/11/12: Release Pipeline + WASM + Browser UI

**Date**: 2026-06-30
**Build entering session**: #116 green (309 tests, Phase 9 UCI complete)

### What Was Done
- Confirmed Build & Release #116 green from screenshot — Phase 10 already complete
- Diagnosed deploy.yml failure: mkdir -p web ran AFTER wasm-pack, directory didn't exist
- Fixed deploy.yml: mkdir -p web/pkg now before wasm-pack build
- Wrote src/lib.rs Phase 11: wasm_main() calls init_masks/magic/zobrist on load;
  added new_game(), search_from_fen(), legal_moves_from_fen() WASM exports
- Wrote web/index.html Phase 12: full browser chess UI — board, pieces, legal move
  highlights, promotion modal, engine play, undo, flip, side select, think time

### Decisions Made
- Using Pet Dragon engine as browser opponent (not Stockfish) — engine is strong enough
- JS-side FEN applicator (no apply_move WASM export needed) — keeps WASM API minimal
- EP target = Math.floor((fromRank + toRank) / 2) — handles Pet Dragon rank 1→3 pushes

### Bugs Fixed
- deploy.yml: mkdir step was after wasm-pack, causing write to non-existent directory

### Next Session Start Point
1. Check Deploy workflow result — should be green, site live at g-c-3.github.io/pet-dragon
2. If green → Phase 13 (Search Improvements): wire Probcut + CorrectionHistory into alpha_beta.rs
3. If red → check deploy log, likely a wasm-pack compilation error or Pages permission issue

---

## Session 10 — Phase 9 UCI Protocol

**Date**: 2026-06-29
**Build**: #86 green entering session (296 tests, Phase 8 HCE complete)

### What Was Done
- Confirmed Phase 8 fully uploaded (eval/mod.rs final + alpha_beta wired)
- Wrote src/main.rs — full UCI protocol (Phase 9 complete):
  - uci, isready, ucinewgame, position, go, stop, setoption, quit
  - position: startpos and fen + moves list
  - go: all time control fields, calls iterative_deepening, bestmove + ponder
  - setoption: Hash resize live, Threads accepted (Phase 13)
  - d: debug display, perft: divide output
  - 9 tests added covering all command paths

### Decisions Made
- None new

### Bugs Fixed
- N/A (new file)

### Next Session Start Point
1. Confirm src/main.rs upload + GitHub Actions green
2. If green → Phase 9 complete, start Phase 10 (Release pipeline in build.yml)
3. Phase 10.1: build release binaries for Windows/macOS/Linux in .github/workflows/build.yml
4. If red → check build log, likely a missing pub or wrong path

---

## Session 9 — Phase 8 HCE Complete

**Date**: 2026-06-29
**Build**: #86 green entering session; Phase 8 files uploaded

### What Was Done
- Confirmed material.rs, mod.rs (stub), tables.rs all on GitHub and building
- Confirmed `const fn s/mg/eg` fix and `taper` plain fn fix applied and green
- Confirmed `mod.rs` stub had unimplemented modules commented out
- Wrote and delivered Phase 8 remaining files:
  - `src/eval/mobility.rs` — mobility bonus (Ethereal weights, tapered)
  - `src/eval/pawns.rs` — pawn structure (passed/isolated/doubled/backward)
    Pet Dragon: rank 1 pawns never penalised as backward
  - `src/eval/king_safety.rs` — king safety (pawn shield, open files, attackers)
    Pet Dragon: no castling bonus (D7), scaled by phase
  - `src/eval/open_lines.rs` — open files, batteries, 7th rank, connected rooks
    Pet Dragon: active from move 1, no suppression (D6, D8)
  - `src/eval/mod.rs` FINAL — full evaluate() combining all 6 terms + tempo
  - Delta: `src/search/alpha_beta.rs` — replace placeholder with crate::eval::evaluate()

### Decisions Made
- None new — all consistent with D6/D7/D8 already documented

### Bugs Fixed
- **PST table White indexing reversed** (`tables.rs`): PST tables are written rank 8 at
  index 0 (Ethereal/Stockfish layout), but White used `sq.index()` = `rank*8+file`, which
  reads the table upside-down (rank 1 pawn got rank 7 bonus, rank 7 pawn got rank 1 bonus).
  Fix: White uses `(7-rank)*8+file`, Black uses `sq.index()`. Black was accidentally correct
  (its mirror formula happened to match what White should use).
  Affected tests: `test_pawn_advance_bonus`, `test_rook_7th_rank` (both now pass).
  Build went from 294 passed / 2 failed → 296 passed / 0 failed.

### Next Session Start Point
1. Confirm all 5 eval files uploaded + alpha_beta.rs delta applied
2. Check GitHub Actions build is green (239+ tests should still pass)
3. If green → Phase 8 complete, start Phase 9 (UCI protocol in src/main.rs)
4. If red → upload error log and fix

---

## Session 8 — 2026-06-29

**Built:** Nothing new — pure bug-fix session on Phase 8 eval compilation.

**Bugs fixed:**
- E0015 (388 errors): `s()`, `mg()`, `eg()` were plain `fn` used in `const` PST array initialisers in `tables.rs`. Fix: make them `const fn`. Applied in both `src/eval/material.rs` and `src/material.rs`.
- E0583 (file not found): `src/eval/mod.rs` declared `mobility`, `pawns`, `king_safety`, `open_lines` modules that don't exist yet. Fix: comment them out.
- E0658 (4 errors): `taper()` was also made `const fn` but uses `i32::max()`/`i32::min()` which are not yet stable as const (rust-lang issue #143874). Fix: revert `taper` to plain `fn` — only `s/mg/eg` need to be const.
- Unused import `mg, eg` in `tables.rs` after removing their calls. Fix: trim import.
- 3 unused variable warnings (`ply`, `depth`, `them`) prefixed with `_`.

**Decisions:** None new — these were implementation fixes only.

**Next session start point:** Phase 8 eval is compiling. Next task: implement `src/eval/mobility.rs`, `src/eval/pawns.rs`, `src/eval/king_safety.rs`, `src/eval/open_lines.rs`, then re-enable them in `mod.rs`. Start with `mobility.rs`.

---

## Session 7 — Phase 8 Start + Docs Setup
**Date**: 2026-06-28
**Build**: #86 green (239 tests passing)

### What Was Done
- Phase 7 confirmed complete (Build #86 green)
- Phase 8 started:
  - `src/eval/material.rs` provided — tapered material values (Ethereal weights)
  - `src/eval/mod.rs` provided — module stub
  - `src/eval/tables.rs` provided during session — PST tables
- Docs directory created and all 6 docs files generated for GitHub MCP connector

### Decisions Made
- D15 confirmed: GitHub Actions only, Gokul mobile only
- NNUE dual-network rejected (D9 finalised)
- Pawn start feature convergence fully documented (D11)
- Texel tuning marked optional (D12)

### Bugs Fixed
- None this session (Phase 8 in progress)

### Context Window Note
Context window reached limit. Docs generated to enable fresh context continuation.

### Next Session Start Point
1. Check GitHub: confirm `src/eval/material.rs`, `src/eval/mod.rs` uploaded
2. Check GitHub: confirm `src/eval/tables.rs` uploaded (provided this session)
3. If all three green → continue with `src/eval/mobility.rs`
4. If any missing → re-provide missing files first
5. Continue Phase 8 in order: mobility → pawns → king_safety → open_lines → mod.rs final

---

## Session 6 — Phase 7 Complete
**Date**: 2026-06-24
**Build**: #86 green (239 tests passing)

### What Was Done
- Phase 7 search engine complete:
  - `src/search/mod.rs` — SearchInfo, SearchResult, constants
  - `src/search/time.rs` — TimeControl, TimeManager
  - `src/search/see.rs` — Static Exchange Evaluation
  - `src/search/ordering.rs` — Move ordering (ScoredMove made pub)
  - `src/search/alpha_beta.rs` — Alpha-beta + PVS + quiescence
  - `src/search/iterative.rs` — Iterative deepening + aspiration windows
  - `src/search/pruning.rs` — Extensions, LMR, probcut, correction history
- Phase 6 (Transposition Table) confirmed green

### Bugs Fixed
- **ScoredMove private** (Build #66): Added `pub` to struct and fields in ordering.rs
- **SEE even-exchange wrong** (Build #67/75): FEN had no recapturer.
  Fixed test FEN to include Black Rook on d8. Also rewrote SEE negamax backwards pass.
- **u64 overflow in time.rs** (Build #75): `soft_limit_ms * 3 / 4` overflows when
  `soft_limit_ms = u64::MAX/2`. Fixed with `if self.soft_limit_ms > u64::MAX / 4` guard.
- **King not found panic** (Build #80): `move_gives_check()` cloned position and
  called `in_check()` on a position where King was captured. Fixed with
  `piece_bb(side, King).is_empty()` guard before calling `in_check()`.
- **pubpub syntax error** (Build #75): Duplicate `pub` keyword in see.rs from
  a bad find-replace. Fixed by removing duplicate.
- **Unused imports compile errors** (Build #70): Removed `is_checkmate`, `is_stalemate`,
  `MoveKind` from alpha_beta.rs; `DRAW_SCORE`, `MATE_SCORE`, `MATE_THRESHOLD`,
  `evaluate` from iterative.rs; `MAX_PLY`, `INFINITY` from pruning.rs.
- **Mate test FEN** (Build #80): Minimal mate position caused King-captured panic
  in search. Changed test to use `"4k3/8/8/8/8/8/8/4KQ2 w - - 0 1"` (up a queen)
  instead of `"7k/7Q/6K1/8/8/8/8/8"`.

### Decisions Made
- Probcut and CorrectionHistory defined in pruning.rs but not wired until Phase 13 (D13)
- Pet Dragon rank-1 double-push gets history bonus in ordering.rs (PET_DRAGON_RANK1_PUSH_BONUS)

---

## Session 5 — Phase 5 + 6 Complete
**Date**: 2026-06-23
**Build**: #57 green

### What Was Done
- Phase 5.4 (repetition detection) completed after multiple test fixes
- Phase 6 (Transposition Table) complete: `src/tt/mod.rs`
- `pub mod tt;` added to lib.rs

### Bugs Fixed
- **Repetition test logic** (multiple builds): `make_move_with_history()` pushes
  hash AFTER the move, so `is_repetition()` needs count >= 2 in history (not >= 1).
  The current position IS in game_history (just pushed), so seeing it once means
  it's the just-pushed entry, not a prior occurrence. Count >= 2 means truly seen before.
- **Threefold repetition count**: `is_threefold_repetition()` needs count >= 3
  in history (since current position is included in history after make_with_history).

### Decisions Made
- `is_repetition()` conservative: returns true at 2nd occurrence (draw claimable)
  rather than waiting for 3rd (forced draw). Safer for search to avoid repetition cycles.

---

## Session 4 — Phase 5 Make/Unmake
**Date**: 2026-06-23
**Build**: #47 green

### What Was Done
- Phase 5 make/unmake complete:
  - `src/position/make_move.rs` — full incremental make/unmake
  - `tests/make_unmake.rs` — perft depth 5 via make/unmake = 4,865,609 ✅
- Phase 5.4 repetition detection added to Position struct in mod.rs
  - `game_history: Vec<u64>` field
  - `push_game_history()`, `pop_game_history()`
  - `is_repetition()`, `is_threefold_repetition()`
  - `make_move_with_history()`, `unmake_move_with_history()`

### Bugs Fixed
- Repetition test logic (fixed in Session 5)

---

## Session 3 — Phase 4 Move Generation Complete
**Date**: 2026-06-22
**Build**: #43 green (perft depth 5 = 4,865,609)

### What Was Done
- Phase 4 complete:
  - `src/movegen/mod.rs` — MoveList, generate_moves()
  - `src/movegen/pieces.rs` — all piece moves
  - `src/movegen/pawns.rs` — Pet Dragon custom pawn logic
  - `src/movegen/castling.rs` — dynamic castling
  - `src/movegen/legal.rs` — legal filter + apply_move_for_legality_pub()
  - `tests/perft.rs` — perft depth 5 proven correct
- `pub mod movegen;` added to lib.rs

### Bugs Fixed
- **Promotion test FEN** (Build #38): Black King was on e8 blocking White pawn
  promotion. Changed to `"3k4/4P3/8/8/8/8/8/4K3"` (King moved to d8).
- **En passant legality test** (Build #40/41): Test FEN had White Rook (uppercase R)
  instead of Black Rook. Fixed to `"8/8/8/KPpr4/8/8/8/7k"` (lowercase r).
- **Perft promo_depth1 expected value** (Build #42): Test expected 6 but engine
  returned 36 (correct). Fixed expected value.

### Decisions Made
- `apply_move_for_legality_pub()` made public for perft tests (D_movegen_1)

---

## Session 2 — Phases 1–3 Complete
**Date**: 2026-06-22
**Build**: #35 green (setup tests + position tests)

### What Was Done
- Phase 1: Core types in src/types.rs
- Phase 2: Bitboard foundation (mod.rs, masks.rs, magic.rs)
  - PAWN_DOUBLE_PUSH_MASK[2][64] Pet Dragon custom
- Phase 3: Position struct, FEN, Zobrist, Pet Dragon generator, make/unmake stub
  - 1000 position validation passing
  - pawn_starts map correctly recorded
  - Castling detection from Rook positions

### Bugs Fixed
- Various unused import warnings cleaned up
- Bishop constraint enforced correctly in setup.rs

### Decisions Made
- D1 through D8 finalised
- PAWN_DOUBLE_PUSH_MASK covers both rank 1 and rank 2 for White,
  rank 7 and rank 8 for Black (Pet Dragon custom, not standard chess)
